## Challenge 15

### Challenge Summary

- create a binary tree and a binary search tree

### Solution

- Utilizing Node, and a walk method, created a binary search tree

### Tests

- [check em out!](/python/tests/test_binary_tree.py)

## Challenge 16

### Challenge Summary 16

- Partner Tim Vicarri
- Create a method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing built in methods, return the maximum value stored in the tree

### Whiteboard

- [Check it out!](/python/BinaryTree/WB15.png)

### Approach

- utilizing the previously built in storage for our tree, use a simple recursive statement to find and return the maximum value stored in that list

## Challenge 17

### Challenge 17 Summary

- Develop a function that traverses across a binary tree in breadth first, rather than branch first

### Whiteboard 17

### Approach chal 17

- Develop a standalone function, utilizing a built in Queue library, to walk across a tree of unknown depth
